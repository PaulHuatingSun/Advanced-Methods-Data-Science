    "    1. (10pt) Present your results in a single table with the following columns and 14 (or so) rows. The table should look something like this:\n",
    "    Suggestion: use t-test to determine whether the difference between Tand Cvillages is statistically significant for each of the variables in the dataset. Focus only on the data from 1997 for poor. Ignore variables such as folnum and village that do not carry social significance. t-test can be done with t.test in R. For instance t.test(x, y) compares two unpaired vectors xand y, and outputs confidence intervals, p-value, and other things.\n",
    "    Suggestion 2: There are many ways you can create this table, here is one suggestion you may follow:\n",
    "    (a) create an empty data frame that contains the values you need: variable name, average for T, average for C, their difference, and p-value from t-test. In R, you can also just create a NULL-object:\n",
    "    df <- NULL\n",
    "    This will be your final data frame, the one you will print.\n",
    "    (b) do a for-loop over all the variable names, data for which you want to compare. Inside the loop:\n",
    "    (c) extract the variable (your loop variable) values for Tand Cgroup as separate vectors\n",
    "    (d) compute averages of these two vectors\n",
    "    (e) compute p-value for t-test between these two vectors\n",
    "    (f) create a new one-line data frame (one row of the required table) that contains the values for this variable only.\n",
    "    (g) attach this new one-line data frame to the final data frame (the one you created as empty). You can use rbind as\n",
    "      df <- rbind(df, newDF)\n",
    "      As a result, your data frame will contain all the required values for all the variables. You can use knitr::kable or xtable library to print it in a nicer way. You can use argument check.names=FALSE to create a data frame with non-syntactic variable names, e.g. ones that contain space like “p value”."
